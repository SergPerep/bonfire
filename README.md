## Why

Calculating energy expenses is hard and non-trivial. Energy-supplier gives you its rates, but it's not enough to figure out how much money you'll spend at the end of the year. You have to keep in mind the energy tax reduction that the government sets up every ear for electricity, and know that apart of an energy supplier you also pay to a grid owner â€“ its prices are not included in energy rates.

This app handles all calculations instead of you. It gives you an approximate estimate of your annual/monthly expenses. Just grab the contract, that you signed up with an energy supplier, and fill up a form on the app.
